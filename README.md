The objective of this project is to develop a comprehensive
system for the ADXL377 accelerometer, configured as an
inclinometer to measure pitch (forward/backward tilt) and
roll (side-to-side tilt) angles. The system includes the
design and construction of a signal conditioning circuit to
adapt the accelerometer for inclination measurements.
After constructing the circuit, an adjustment process is
performed using an ellipsoidal fitting procedure, followed
by a precise calibration to ensure optimal performance of
the entire system. The user can utilize the system to
measure pitch and roll angles in real-time, with the ability
to adjust the system for improved measurement accuracy.
The visualization of the yaw angle is not supported.
